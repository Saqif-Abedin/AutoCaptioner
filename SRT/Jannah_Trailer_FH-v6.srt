00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:03,341
Some people seem to have
it so hard in this life,

3
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:05,550
and others seem to be living it up.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,940
But don't stare too long at
the lofty palaces and homes

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,930
or the wild parties and seemingly
unrestricted self-worship,

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,510
where people are led by their every desire

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,650
or through your phone

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,850
at the highly filtered
happiness of others.

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,500
Because behind those screens
and beneath those layers

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,410
may be pain and emptiness
of a different type.

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,500
And whatever our states
may seem like in this life,

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,020
our inevitable fate is the same,

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,070
but things are not always what they seem.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,530
Within those graves are gardens of reward

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,570
or chambers of punishment.

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,320
And within our hearts is either
the pleasure of certainty

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,360
in knowing that there
is something far greater

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,970
than this world or the pain of emptiness

19
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,950
and not knowing at all.

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,760
Oh believer, this world was
not meant to be your paradise,

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,860
but knowing that paradise awaits

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,550
makes this journey so much
more bearable and rewardable.

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,610
Because while every
difficulty is temporary,

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,190
every moment is an opportunity.

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,440
And you know that if you get this right,

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,270
that after all your struggles,

27
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,550
after all your tests and trials,

28
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,190
after all your loves and losses,

29
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,800
your eternal sanctuary awaits.

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,520
Built by your deeds and
decorated by your duas,

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,000
a jewel encrusted crown
for a verse once recited,

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,180
chalets of crystal
sparkling on the horizon

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,990
for a soul that gave up sin,
tree trunks of green emerald

34
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,070
and branches of gold for a
simple word of remembrance.

35
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,170
The company of blessed people you chose

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,660
to accompany, who strove like you

37
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,570
and from past generations
you chose to follow

38
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,610
that taught you how to strive.

39
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,620
Each of your shuddering breaths,

40
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,230
every second of discomfort you faced

41
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,870
and every one of your sacrifices,

42
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,030
all have been accounted for,

43
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,830
repaid with sights and rewards

44
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,670
unimaginable and the
company of the most high.

45
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,800
Build your eternal home.

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,960
Decorate your eternal home.

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,240
Long for your eternal home.

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,092
Welcome to your eternal home.

49
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:11,592
