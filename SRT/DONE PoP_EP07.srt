00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:01,816
- In this episode,

3
00:00:01,816 --> 00:00:03,860
we want to move on to how the simplicity

4
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,200
of the prophet's lifestyle,

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,990
peace and blessings be upon him,

6
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,880
and the humility with
which he carried himself

7
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,700
is yet another strong endorsement

8
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,509
for his claim to prophethood.

9
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,676
(atmospheric chiming)

10
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,525
You see the lifestyle of the prophets,

11
00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,140
Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,580
was a true testament that his mission

13
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,610
could not have been self-serving.

14
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,480
And, we can read all throughout history

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,320
about imposter prophets.

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,640
What were their lives like?

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,750
What were their personalities like?

18
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,480
Their pretentious behavior,
their decadent lifestyles,

19
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,680
their extravagance,

20
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,770
and their exploitation of others.

21
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,170
Whereas, the Prophet Muhammad,

22
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,890
peace and blessings be upon him,

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,500
at the end of his mission,

24
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,600
he became the undisputed ruler of Arabia.

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,610
Yet, you find no semblance of luxury

26
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,440
in any sphere of his life.

27
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,090
His living quarters were tight and meager,

28
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,940
to the point that his wife
says he would tap her leg

29
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,440
when he would want to
prostrate in his night vigils,

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,680
in his night prayers,

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,150
so he would have room to place
his forehead on the ground.

32
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,590
The Prophet Muhammad, peace
and blessings be upon him,

33
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,590
one month after another,
after another, she says,

34
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,530
would pass

35
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,350
without any fire being
kindled in his house,

36
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,740
meaning no cooking, meaning no meats.

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,080
And, there would be nothing
but water and dates, she said,

38
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,310
unless one of his companions
would gift him a jug of milk.

39
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,260
One time, Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb,

40
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,810
may Allah be pleased with him,

41
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,610
walked in and saw that little water skin

42
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,270
hanging in the prophets room,

43
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,600
and the straw mats that he slept on,

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,660
having left marks on his side.

45
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,220
So, out of sympathy for
the great prophet of God,

46
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,120
he had an emotional meltdown, he cried.

47
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,180
And, the Prophet Muhammad,

48
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,320
peace and blessings be upon him,

49
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,650
asked him, "What makes you cry?"

50
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,700
He said, "How can this be?

51
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,570
You are God's prophet, God's
final messenger to humanity.

52
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,540
And, you will live like
this, a life of hardships.

53
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,610
While Rome and Persia have emperors

54
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,800
that are frolicking in
their gardens and meadows,

55
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,640
enjoying their fountains and springs,

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,840
how can this be?"

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,010
And, so the Prophet Muhammad,

58
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,160
peace and blessings be upon him,

59
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,510
said to him, "Are you in doubt, Umar?

60
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,490
Are you in doubt regarding
the reward of the Hereafter?

61
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,420
These are a people whose pleasures

62
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,450
whose enjoyment has been
expedited for them in this,

63
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,150
meaning this, this shallow world.

64
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,030
Don't you know,

65
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,430
don't you remember,

66
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,750
that for them is this world,

67
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,010
and for us, is the Hereafter?"

68
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,420
You know the famous historian,

69
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,710
Washington Irving,

70
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,470
upon citing how Mohammed,

71
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,890
peace and blessings be upon him,

72
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,400
in all the biographical reports about him,

73
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,870
would milk his own animal,

74
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,790
and he would sew, stitch his own clothing,

75
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,623
and was a human,

76
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:40,010
just like any other human being,

77
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,400
except that he claimed to
receive revelation from God.

78
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,070
Washington Irving says,

79
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,120
this was a man who never indulged

80
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,390
in the magnificence of apparel,

81
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,970
he says, which is the
ostentation of a petty mind.

82
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,100
Meaning, only foolish
people show off in this way.

83
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,360
Whereas, Mohammed was
above seeking validation

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,820
from such a trivial source,

85
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,400
meaning materialism.

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,330
When he would arrive at a gathering,

87
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,710
he would not like it
that anyone rise for him

88
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,370
and his companion, Anas ibn
Mâlik, radi'Allahu anhu,

89
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,300
would say, "We used to want
to stand up in salutation

90
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,810
out of honor for him,

91
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,570
to honor him with our
greeting as we stand erect,

92
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,050
but we knew how much he hated that,

93
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,020
and that was the only
thing that kept us seated."

94
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,490
He was the greatest educator of all time

95
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,520
that still was never ashamed to say,

96
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,010
"I don't know."

97
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,700
He was the busiest statesmen of all time,

98
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,540
yet he would allow the
weakest members of society

99
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,640
to take him by hand to
wherever they needed.

100
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,660
He was the greatest husband of all time,

101
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,120
that still left room

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,380
and was sensitive enough to notice

103
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,970
when his wives happened
to be upset at him.

104
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,550
He was the greatest prophet
and messenger of all time.

105
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,720
And, yet he would still say to the people,

106
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,360
do not aggrandized me.

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,650
Don't overpraise me

108
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,110
the way they did with my brother,

109
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,490
Jesus, the son of Mary,

110
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,560
I am but a slave.

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,010
So, say the slave of God,

112
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,270
the servant of God and His messenger,

113
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,540
and in another beautiful hadith,

114
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,610
he said, "The example of me,

115
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,660
and the previous prophets before me,

116
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,950
is like the example of
a magnificent building,

117
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,580
a brilliant building that
people walk around it and say,

118
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,900
'How marvelous.'

119
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,910
Were it not for this one missing brick

120
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,400
in one of its corners.

121
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,450
He says, I am just that brick.

122
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,620
I am that brick.

123
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,450
And, I am the seal of the prophets."

124
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,275
