2
00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:03,154
In these next few episodes, we want to

3
00:00:03,154 --> 00:00:05,878
tour through the remarkable personality

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:08,776
and unique character of
the prophet Muhammad,

5
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,472
peace and blessings be upon him,

6
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:12,726
as one of the strongest cases

7
00:00:12,726 --> 00:00:14,370
in support of his prophethood.

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,392
And we have to begin with honesty.

9
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:17,785
Because the prophet Muhammad,

10
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:19,362
peace and blessings be upon him,

11
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:22,460
was not just a man whose
honesty and integrity

12
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,560
were well-known among his people.

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,602
This was a man who was literally,

14
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:30,634
officially, nicknamed El
Amin, The Trustworthy.

15
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:33,385
(air whooshes)
(choir vocalizes)

16
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:35,188
(air whooshes)

17
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:37,767
When the tribes at the time before Islam

18
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:40,407
were quarreling and they saw him enter

19
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,797
through the door, they said,

20
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:44,700
"Let us all concede to his judgment,"

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,223
and everyone accepted.

22
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:48,000
They said, "This is El Amin coming,

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,233
the trustworthy.

24
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:51,320
We all know he is uncorruptible.

25
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,940
He is removed from his ego.

26
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,790
He is totally impartial,

27
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,112
even if it would not be in the favor

28
00:00:57,112 --> 00:01:00,945
of his tribe, his clan,
his family, his people,

29
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:04,640
the way all of us are
biased in that respect."

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,485
And in fact, even when
he came with his message,

31
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:09,872
when Islam was revealed to him,

32
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:12,250
the Qur'an descended upon him,

33
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,318
and people actively fought him,

34
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:16,168
and persecuted his followers

35
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:18,162
out of their tribal bigotries.

36
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,890
They still, as his wife Ayesha,

37
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,758
may Allah be pleased with her said,

38
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:25,690
would entrust their most
prized possessions with him.

39
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,210
They used to keep things with Muhammad

40
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,893
for safekeeping because of how much

41
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:33,502
they trusted him, even at a time

42
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:35,673
when they were actively fighting him.

43
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:38,390
What does that say about
their understanding

44
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,870
regarding his incorruptibility,

45
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,208
his sublime integrity?

46
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,720
The truthful, the trustworthy Muhammad,

47
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,690
peace and blessings be upon him.

48
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,982
In another incident

49
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:50,950
that's been authentically established,

50
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,432
the prophet Muhammad, peace
and blessings be upon him,

51
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:56,105
had a son named Ibrahim radiAllahu Anhu.

52
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:58,748
Ibrahim had died as a toddler,

53
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:01,920
and it coincided that
on the day of his death,

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,238
a solar eclipse took place.

55
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:07,073
The world went darkened on the daytime.

56
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:09,532
People began to say, "Oh, the skies

57
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:12,142
must be saddened by the death

58
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:15,214
of the son of the Prophet of God."

59
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:16,514
What did the prophet Muhammad,

60
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:18,397
peace and blessings be upon him, do?

61
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:20,790
Well, what would you expect him to do?

62
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,550
Had he been in it claiming prophethood

63
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,745
as a means of self promotion,

64
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:28,770
he would have surely seen this

65
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,080
as a super-convenient credibility booster

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,398
and capitalized on it.

67
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:36,618
But instead, despite the fact

68
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:39,668
that he was grieving
over the loss of his son,

69
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:41,960
and despite the fact that he did not

70
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,215
state this, rumors were spreading

71
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:45,952
about this from others.

72
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:47,565
He still left his home

73
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,413
and headed towards the pulpit

74
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:52,185
and climbed that altar,
and said to the people,

75
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,183
"O people, listen!

76
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:57,050
The sun and the moon do not eclipse

77
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,210
for the death or the birth of anyone.

78
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,417
Rather, they are simply two

79
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,790
of the ayaat, the signs of God,"

80
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,982
part of the cosmic
manifestations of God's power.

81
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:10,492
He said, "by which He strikes fear

82
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:12,268
into the hearts of His servants.

83
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:14,765
He humbles His slaves by
the likes of these events.

84
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:17,737
So when you see these, pray to God

85
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:20,028
and give charity for the sake of God,

86
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:22,825
and free slaves, and remember God

87
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:25,580
until this ordeal passes."

88
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,440
In another very indicative event,

89
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,018
reflecting the integrity of

90
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:32,710
the prophet Muhammad, peace
and blessings be upon him,

91
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,662
Huthayfah ibn al-Yaman, may
Allah be pleased with him,

92
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:37,447
another one of his companions,

93
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,900
had been able to escape from Mecca,

94
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,380
and was released by the idolaters

95
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,722
of Quraysh, who lived in Mecca,

96
00:03:44,722 --> 00:03:47,158
on the condition, "We will leave you

97
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:49,430
and your father to go to Muhammad

98
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,708
and be muslims on the condition

99
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,532
that if he ever fights us one day,

100
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:56,733
you will never join his ranks

101
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,540
and support him, Muhammad, against us."

102
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,402
By the time Huthayfah
reached the prophet Muhammad,

103
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:04,193
peace and blessings be upon him,

104
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:06,759
it was a moment and a day

105
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,485
when the muslims were
about to find themselves

106
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:12,730
facing 900 to 1000 combatants;

107
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,980
and they were outnumbered three to one.

108
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,280
They were about 317 or 319,

109
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,420
what came to be known
as the Battle of Badr.

110
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,090
And so, no artillery, no numbers,

111
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,960
none of the odds in their favor.

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,992
Huthayfah says, "O messenger of Allah,

113
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:30,412
I have an ethical dilemma.

114
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:33,252
I was released by them, and they let me go

115
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:35,215
after giving them a solemn oath,

116
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:37,480
a promise that I would never support

117
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,130
you in combat against them.

118
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,305
So what do I do?

119
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:43,097
I need to support you, you're in need;

120
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:45,538
but I promised them
and gave them my word."

121
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:47,094
Even in that moment,

122
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:48,257
even with the pressing need,

123
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:50,428
the prophet Muhammad, peace
and blessings be upon him,

124
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:52,524
said, wafu lahum a'hadahum.

125
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,490
"You keep your promise to them

126
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,731
And go on, go to Medina

127
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:57,183
Don't stay here with us,"

128
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:59,282
Wa Nasta'eenullaha 'Alayhim

129
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:02,260
"and we will seek God's
help against them."

130
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,302
May the peace and blessings of Allah

131
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:07,325
be upon Muhammad the
truthful, the trustworthy,

132
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:09,405
the unparalleled in his integrity,

133
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:11,298
SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam.
